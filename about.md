Here I will show what is going on, but always feel free to reach me by [mail](mailto:eng.caioamaral@gmail.com) or [social media](https://www.instagram.com/caioamaral/).

I am a mix of maker, engineer, musician and father of Anthony. I am brazillian, but half of my heart belongs to the world.

I am graduate Control and Automation Engineer from Federal Universisty of Santa Catarina (UFSC) right in [Florian√≥polis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQysmKz392k), a paradisiac island in south Brazil. If you're wondering... yes, lucky me! :D
