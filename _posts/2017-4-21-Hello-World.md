Get to know a bit about me and why I have this page!

Contact informations are in [about](/about).

In this page I will share large spectrum stuff that can fly somewhere between playing drums and welding. I love making things and that explains a lot about me.

It all started with this ping-pong robot.

I've built it when I was around 15-16 years old. Fully analog, arduino wasn't around yet. Actually I didn't even know microcontrollers existed. By that time I've decided to be an engineer and never gave up.

While studing engineering I have joined a group of amazing students. Our main goal was to build the most efficient vehicle ever. We haven't got that far on [that time](http://noticias.ufsc.br/2012/04/equipe-ufsc-de-eficiencia-energetica-conquista-setimo-lugar-na-shell-eco-marathon-nos-eua/).. although we had a loot of fun!

After that, in 2013, I have been for a year studing in United Kingdom. And what is not a secret to anyone, but it changed my life. I went to study MSc in Embedded Microelectronics and Wireless Systems, in Coventry, but came back with a baby!!

What a year of experiences, travels, friendships, love, check it out!

After that in 2014, a new Caio had grown out of me. Anthony, my son, was born in October 2014, I have now oficially joined the dad's club. Check how it was his first years, from his mom's point of view!

Througout my life I haven't sit for a breeze, I am continiously studying and pushing myself to learn and experience on a daily manner. I trully believe we gotta go out of confort zone to keep growing. Sitting long hours in front of TV, or sleeping till late isn't really my style. I like being in a fast paced environment and feeling myself in continuous improvement.

This blog is here to help me out to express myself and get to know more people, just like you. Leave a comment :)
